# E.coli-predictive-model
An attempt to create a really basic predictive model of beach closures due to E.coli based off of temperature, precipitation, and waterfowl migration patterns. 
Model will be trained on closure data from the Minnesota Three Rivers park district, using their criteria for closures as well. 
Waterfowl data is still tbd. Three Rivers says Canada Geese are the main bird of concern so I may just run with them.
